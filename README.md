Brief Implementation:
Detection of defected fruits and the classification of fresh and rotten fruits represent one of the major challenges in the agricultural fields. Rotten fruits may cause damage to the other fresh fruits if not classified properly. Traditionally this classification is done by men, which is labour-intensive, time taking, and not efficient procedure. Thus, factories need human intervention for segregation of fruits.
Hence, we need an automated system which can reduce the efforts of humans and time of production. Our system will automatically do that with help of CNN classification Algorithm. The proposed idea will create a segregation model which would need no human intervention for classifying and segregating fruits.
